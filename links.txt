"Early on in Computex, Corsair unveiled the new
Corsair Force MP300 NVMe 1.3 TB M.2 SSD. Corsair announced the
drive during our flight over, so we learned about it at the
company's booth where the drive was prominently on display.
The Corsair website shows the price ranging from just $49 (120GB)
to $320 (960GB)."
